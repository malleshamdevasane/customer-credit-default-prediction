  - `notebooks/eda/eda_main.ipynb` – Perform exploratory data analysis
  - `src/data/` – Create reusable functions for loading and cleaning data
  - `src/features/` – Add scripts for feature engineering
- Output your cleaned dataset into `data/processed/`

### 👤 Member 2 – Modeling & Deployment
- Work on:
  - `notebooks/modeling/model_training.ipynb` – Try different machine learning models
  - `notebooks/modeling/model_evaluation.ipynb` – Evaluate and compare models
  - `src/models/` – Add training, validation, and inference scripts
- Use processed data from `data/processed/`

### 👤 Member 3 – Final Analysis, Conclusions & Report
- Work on:
  - Contribute to `reports/figures/` for charts and visuals
  - Create summary and insight slides for the final presentation
  - Draft the final sections: analysis insights, conclusions, and business recommendations
  - Compile the final report (PDF) using results from other members
